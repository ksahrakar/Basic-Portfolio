    <p>
        Learning coding at 55 is not normal. Nor is learning coding in retirement. 
        Nor is retiring from brain surgery at 55. I am delighted to be a three-time abnormal!
    </p>
    <p>
        Having my first career behind me, I am in the position to pursue my other interests and 
        to realize some of the ideas I have accumulated in frustration during my first career.
        During my practice not a day would pass that I would not encounter an inefficency in programming 
        or suboptimal interaction with technology that could be easily remedied with good prgramming and 
        user interfaces. Frustrations my colleagues and my profession were experiencing in progressing 
        to a more technologically savvy world could be remedied with better programming. I hope to be 
        able to apply my new skills to becoming a conduit between the fast-moving information technology 
        advancements and the health care provider.
